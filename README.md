}
util.inherits(Project, restful.RESTFulResource);

function Gitlab(options) {
  options = options || {};
  options.api = options.api || 'https://gitlab.com/api/v3';
  this.constructor.super_.call(this, options);
  this.token = options.token;

  this.addResources({
    projects: Project
  });
}

util.inherits(Gitlab, restful.RESTFulClient);

Gitlab.prototype.setAuthentication = function (req) {
